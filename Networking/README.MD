# Networking

Networking refers to the process of connecting multiple devices, such as computers, servers, printers, and other electronic devices, to communicate and share resources. The purpose of networking is to facilitate data sharing and communication, allowing users to share information, access resources, and collaborate on projects.

Networking protocols are like rules that help the devices talk to each other in the right way. They tell the devices how to send and receive information so that everything works smoothly. Security is important when networking so that only the people who are supposed to see the information can access it.
