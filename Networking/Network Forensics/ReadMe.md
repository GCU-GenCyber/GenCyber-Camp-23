# Network Forensics
A couple has robbed a bank and after being released on bail, Ann Dercover
disappears! Fortunately, investigators were carefully monitoring her network 
activity before she skipped town. 
“We believe Ann may have communicated with her boyfriend, Mr. X, before she 
left,” says the police chief. “The packet capture may contain clues to her 
whereabouts.”

where she went, and recover evidence including:
