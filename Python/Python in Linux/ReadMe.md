# Python Basics

Python is a popular languarge for scripting in cybersecurity, but it is not only used in this field. Python is a great initial language for anyone interested in programming. 

To start, we are going to need to create a file that will allow you to execute python in the Linux terminal. Go ahead and create a file with the file extention of '.py'. Then, change the permissions of this file to make it executable. 

Here's some commands that will help.

    touch file.py
    chmod +x file.py
    
Now open the file with the editor of your choosing, for this lesson, I will be using gedit.

For Linux, to use the python functions, you will need to add the following to the top of the file.

    #!/bin/python3
    
Now we can begin writing code.
