# Python 

Python is a computer language that people use to tell computers what to do. Just like we use different languages to talk to each other, we use different computer languages to talk to computers. Python is one of these languages that people use to tell computers what to do.

Python is special because it's easy to learn and use compared to other languages. It's like giving the computer a list of instructions or steps to follow, and then it does what we tell it to do. For example, we could tell the computer to print out "Hello, world!" on the screen, and it would do just that.

People use Python for all kinds of things. Some use it to make websites, others use it for scientific research, and some even use it to make video games. There are lots of tools and resources available to help people learn Python and start using it to create their own programs. Many cybersecurity professionals will also use Python to automate processes or tasks that they have to do repeatedly.
