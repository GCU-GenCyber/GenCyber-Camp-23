# Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain

The Lockheed Cyber Kill Chain is a methodology used to understand the steps of a cyber attack. It was developed by Lockheed Martin, a leading aerospace and defense company, and has been widely adopted as a framework for analyzing cyber threats.

The Cyber Kill Chain consists of seven stages, each representing a different phase in the attack process. These stages are:

#### 1. Reconnaissance:

The attacker gathers information about the target organization. This can include scanning networks, searching social media, and analyzing public records.

#### 2. Weaponization: 

The attacker creates or obtains a malware payload that can be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the target's systems.

#### 3. Delivery: 

The attacker delivers the malware payload to the target's systems. This can be done through email attachments, malicious websites, or other means.

#### 4. Exploitation:

The malware payload exploits vulnerabilities in the target's systems to gain access and control.

#### 5. Installation:

The malware is installed on the target's systems and begins executing its malicious code.

#### 6. Command and Control (C2):

The attacker establishes communication with the infected system or network to remotely control it.

#### 7. Actions on Objectives:

The attacker achieves their goals by stealing data, disrupting operations, or causing damage to the target organization.


By understanding each stage of the Cyber Kill Chain, organizations can better prepare for and defend against cyber attacks. This includes implementing security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and user awareness training.

It is important to note that not all attacks follow this exact sequence and that attackers may skip some steps depending on their goals and capabilities. However, using the Cyber Kill Chain as a framework can still provide valuable insights into how attacks are carried out and how they can be prevented or mitigated.
