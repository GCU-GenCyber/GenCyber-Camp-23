# Learning Outcomes

## Lesson Learning Outcomes
1. **Understanding Asymmetric Encryption:** Students will be able to explain the concept of asymmetric encryption and its components, including public keys, private keys, and key pairs. They will recognize that public keys are used for encryption, while private keys are used for decryption.
2. **Practical Use of OpenSSL:** Students will learn how to use OpenSSL, a widely used tool for cryptographic operations, to generate RSA key pairs, encrypt messages using public keys, and decrypt messages using corresponding private keys. They will gain hands-on experience with encryption and decryption processes.
3. **Differentiating Asynchronous Encryption:** Students will be able to distinguish between asynchronous (asymmetric) encryption and synchronous (symmetric) encryption methods. They will understand that asynchronous encryption involves the use of different keys for encryption and decryption, while synchronous encryption uses the same key for both processes.
