# Lesson Details

## Warm Up Activity: Real-Life Encryption Scenario
- **Objective:** To gain attention and stimulate recall of prior learning.
- **Activity:** 
  - Show a short video clip or present a real-life example where data security and encryption are essential.
  - Engage the students in a brief discussion about the potential consequences of data breaches and the need for secure communication.
  - Ask students to recall any prior knowledge they have about encryption.

## Lesson: Expository Approach - PowerPoint Presentation
- **Objective:** To provide an expository approach to introducing the concepts of asymmetric encryption.
- **Content:**
  - Introduction to Encryption.
  - Key Concepts: Explaining public and private keys.
  - Introducing OpenSSL.
  - Generating RSA Key Pairs.
  - Encrypting and Decrypting Messages.
  - Asynchronous vs. Synchronous Encryption.

## Activity: Guided Inquiry Approach - Hands-on OpenSSL Practice
- **Objective:** To allow students to apply their knowledge of asymmetric encryption using OpenSSL in a guided manner.
- **Activity:** 
  - Provide each student with access to a computer with OpenSSL installed.
  - Give step-by-step instructions on generating RSA key pairs, encrypting a sample message, and decrypting the encrypted message using their key pairs.
  - Monitor and assist students as they follow the instructions and perform the encryption and decryption tasks.
