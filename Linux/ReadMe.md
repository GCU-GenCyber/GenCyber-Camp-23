# Linux

Linux is an operating system, just like Windows or MacOS, that manages the communication between your computer's hardware and software applications. However, unlike those other operating systems, Linux is open source, which means that anyone can access, modify, and distribute its source code for free.

Linux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility. It can run on a wide range of hardware platforms, from servers to desktops to mobile devices. It also supports a vast array of software applications, including web servers, databases, programming languages, and multimedia tools.

One of the key features of Linux is its command-line interface, which allows users to interact with the system using text-based commands. This may seem daunting at first, but it offers a great deal of control and customization options. Additionally, Linux has a graphical user interface (GUI) that is similar to other operating systems, making it easy for users to navigate and perform tasks using a mouse and keyboard.
