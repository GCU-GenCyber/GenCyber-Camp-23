# CyberBot Lesson Plan

## Overview

The CyberBot lesson introduces students to the world of robotics and Python programming using the CyberBot robot platform. This lesson offers a practical introduction to robotics, covering programming basics, electronics, and sensor integration.

- **Prerequisite Knowledge**: Familiarity with computers, programming, mathematics, and electronics is helpful but not required.
- **Length**: 3 hours
- **Level**: Suitable for K-12 teachers, middle school, and high school students, particularly beginners.


## Learning Outcomes

- Understand the fundamental principles and applications of robotics.
- Learn programming basics to control the Cyber:Bot, including loops, conditionals, variables, and functions.
- Program the Cyber:Bot for autonomous navigation and obstacle avoidance.
