## Box Penetration Testing

In Cybersecurity, we use a lot of colors to signify roles and types of pentests. For roles, there are a different types of teams that are labeled as colors. For example,
+ Red Team: Offensive/Penetration Testers
+ Blue Team: Defensive/Threat Analysts/Security Operation Center Employees
+ Purple Team: Offensive/Defensive/Red and Blue Team Work Together Closely
+ Yellow Team: Developers and Coders/Builders

For Pentests, There are Three Types of Colored Pentesting Known as Box Penetration Testing. The different colors are assigned based on how much knowledge the pentester has about their Test. For example:

+ Black-box Testing
  + This is the Role of an Average Hacker, meaning they have no Internal or Previous Knowledge of the Target System
  + Testers will not have any information regarding the test, except for the reconnaissance they do on their own via open source
  + This type of test is used to locate vulnerabilities that can be Exploited from outside the network
  + The Tester needs to be able to make their own map of a target/target network based on their findings to keep track of all the information they may have found
  + ***Con: If Testers cannot find a way in, vulns of internal service will remain undiscovered and unpatched***
