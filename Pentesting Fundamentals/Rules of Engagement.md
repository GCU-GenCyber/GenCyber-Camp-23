![AltText](https://github.com/GCU-GenCyber/GenCyber-Camp-23/blob/main/Pentesting%20Fundamentals/img/ROE.jpg)

### A Rules of Engagement Document is Always Created Bewteen the Pentester (or their company) and the Client. This provides a List of Rules and Defines How the Client Wants Their Pentest to be Carried Out. 

There are Three Main Parts to an ROE Document. 
+ Permissions
  + This Section Specifies Permission to the Pentester or Their Company so That They are Legally Protected when Conducting the Pentest

+ Test Scope:
  + This Specifies the Application, Hosts, Servers, etc. that the Client has Allowed the Pentester(s) to Test. Nothing Outside of Scope can Legally be Pentested, or the Testers WILL be Fined and could face legal action and charges

+ Rules:
  + This Defines What Techniques, Tools, and Types of Attacks are Permitted in the Pentest
  + Ex: The Client could Disallow Man-in-the-Middle Attacks, but Allow Phishing Emails to be Sent to Their Staff

***It is important to note that this document and understanding it thoroughly is VITAL to becoming a pentester. Anything conducted outside of the scope could label you as a hacker. Once the industry knows that you hack unethically, it is very hard to get a job because word spreads quickly.***
