## OWASP and OSSTMM 
When someone is pentesting, they usually have a specific way or method that they go about it. Different methods are used for different types of pentests. For example, there are two very well known methodologies that pentesters will use to help them during a pentest. These are not meant to be solely used, but they are tools to help those during a test. 

### OWASP
Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) is a non-profit organization that works around the world to help anybody have great web application security. A web-app is an application that is stored on a remote server and sent over the internet through a browser. Examples of this would include Netflix, Gmail, and Amazon. 
+ OWASP makes sure that their materials are available to anybody and everybody for free to help promote web-app security. 
+ OWASP offers documents, tools, videos, and forums to help people with their security. 
+ Their widely known project that is used by almost all web-app pentesting companies is called the OWASP Top 10. 
  + This List Provides the Top 10 Critical Risks to Web-Apps and is Updated Every Few Years.
  + Companies Use the OWASP Top 10 as an Awareness Document and OWASP Recommends that Companies do What They Can to Mitigate These Risks. 
  + Web-App Pentesters Will Typically Check for These Types of Vulns First. 

### OWASP Top 10 
1. Broken Access Control
2. Cryptographic Failures
3. Injection
4. Insecure Design
5. Security Misconfiguration
6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
7. Identification and Authentication Failures
8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
9. Security Logging and Monitoring
10. Server-Side Request Forgery

### OSSTMM
The Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual was created and is currently maintained by the Institute for Security and Open Methodologies(ISECOM). It is used to help with security auditing and assessing if a company meets particular regulatory and industry requirements. Just like OWASP, it is meant to help pentesters, but it is not a standalone method and should be used to help assure companies that they are meeting necessary requirements. 

### OSSTMM Rules of Engagement
OSSTMM recommends that pentesters produce the following documents with their clients for legal and regulatory reasons. 
+ Project Scope
+ Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Agreements/Assurance
+ Emergency Contact Information
+ Statement of Work Change Process
+ Test Plan
+ Test Process
+ Reporting Standards

There are other documents that could be included with the others; however, these are not mentioned by OSSTMM. 
+ Procurement
+ Project Risk Identification
+ Qualitative and Quantitative Risk Analysis
+ Human Resources
+ Cost Estinates and Controls

### OSSTMM Channels
There are Five Channels, Sections, or Security Areas that OSSTMM covers. For example: 
1. Human Security: Focuses on Security Awareness Training/Social Engineering Attacks
2. Physical Security: Covers Access Controls and Security for Physcial Locations
3. Wireless Communications: Involves Different Forms of WCs including Wi-Fi Networks and RFID
4. Telecommunications: Covers Voice over IP (VoIP), Private Branch eXchange (PBX), and Voicemail. 
5. Data Networks: Focuses on Computer and Network Security and Covers the Following
   + Network surveying
   + Identification
   + Access process
   + Service identification
   + Authentication
   + Spoofing
   + Phishing
   + Resource abuse

### OSSTMM Phases
There is a set of phases that OSSTMM offers that can be used for each channel/section. Those are: 
+ Phase I: Regulatory
    + Posture review – review relevant regulatory and legislative frameworks and standards
    + Logistics – identify any physical and technical constraints to the processes in the channel
    + Active detection verification – evaluate interaction detection and response
