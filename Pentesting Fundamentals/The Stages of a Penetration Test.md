### There are five stages to a penetration test. The graphic above will list them for you. 

### Information Gathering
  + Refers to Research Conducted About the Target/Company
  + Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
  + OSINT Refers to Any Information You Can Gather via Open Source meaning Free, the Internet, Google, etc. 

### Enumeration and Scanning
  + Locate Any Ports, Services, or Applications that are Running on the Target
  + Enumeration is a process that establishes a connection to the target hosts to discover potential attack vectors in the system, and the same can be used for further exploitation of the system.
  + Attack Vectors: Ways to Gain Access to an Infrastructure/System
    + Ex: Weak Configurations, Open Firewall Ports, Lack of User Security Awareness, Missing Patches and Updates

***Fun Fact: Equifax was hacked in 2017 because an Apache web server component (a java component) didn't have certain patches applied even though it was well known around the internet that those vulnerabilities needed to be addressed!!***

  + Enumeration is used to gather the following:
    + Usernames, group names
    + Hostnames
    + Network shares and services
    + IP tables and routing tables
    + Service settings and audit configurations
    + Application and banners
    + SNMP and DNS details
