## Stages of a Penetration Test

![alt text](https://github.com/GCU-GenCyber/GenCyber-Camp-23/blob/main/Pentesting%20Fundamentals/img/Pentest%20Stages.png)

### There are five stages to a penetration test. The graphic above will list them for you. 

### Information Gathering
  + Refers to Research Conducted About the Target/Company
  + Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)
  + OSINT Refers to Any Information You Can Gather via Open Source meaning Free, the Internet, Google, etc. 

### Enumeration and Scanning
  + Locate Any Ports, Services, or Applications that are Running on the Target
  + Conduct a Vulnerability Assessment with a Vulnerability Scanner such as Nessus, OpenVAS, Nikto, etc. to locate Vulnerabilities
  + Enumeration is a process that establishes a connection to the target hosts to discover potential attack vectors in the system, and the same can be used for further exploitation of the system.
  + Attack Vectors: Ways to Gain Access to an Infrastructure/System
    + Ex: Weak Configurations, Open Firewall Ports, Lack of User Security Awareness, Missing Patches and Updates
***
***Fun Fact: Equifax was hacked in 2017 because an Apache web server component (a java component) didn't have certain patches applied even though it was well known around the internet that those vulnerabilities needed to be addressed!!***
***
  + Enumeration is used to gather the following:
    + Usernames, group names
    + Hostnames
    + Network shares and services
    + IP tables and routing tables
    + Service settings and audit configurations
    + Application and banners
    + SNMP and DNS details

### Exploitation 
  + Use the Information Gathered From Phase 1 & 2 to Attempt to Gain Access to the Machines that are Being Tested Within the Scope (View ROE Lesson for Explanation)
  + Analyze the Vulnerability Assessment Results to find ways to Exploit and Attack the Vulns
  + This is Where Pentesters Use Automation Tools to Conduct their Pentests Such as:
    + BurpSuite for Web Application Pentesting
    + SQLMap for Web Application Pentesting 
    + Metasploit for Network/Host Pentesting

### Privilege Escalation
+ This Phase Starts Once an Vulnerability has Already been Exploited
+ The Pentester Will Gain Access to Privileges They Are Not Supposed to Have
+ They do this by exploiting a privilege escalation vulnerability in the target system or application
+ This allows them to override the limitations of the current user account they compromised
+ There are Two Types of Escalation:
 + Horizontal Escalation: Same Permissions, Another User
 + Vertical Escalation: Higher Permissions, Could be Administrator

*** AGAIN!! It is IMPORTANT to note, NOTHING can be done to a system, account, or vulnerability that is NOT SPECIFIED in the RULES OF ENGAGEMENT!! Please view that Lesson to learn more :) ***
