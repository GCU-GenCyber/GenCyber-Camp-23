### WORK IN PROGRESS


Malware is simpiler to create than you might think. This lesson is a demonstration on how malware creation can be automated and tools that allow for attackers to easily create simple pieces of malware. 

The application that we will be using is called JPS Virus Maker 4.0

This applicaiton is completly open source and takes little effort to find and install. 

With this installed the attacker can plug in the features that they want in the program and create the file.
