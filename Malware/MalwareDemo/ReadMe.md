# Malware Demonstration
### WORK IN PROGRESS


Malware is simpiler to create than you might think. This lesson is a demonstration on how malware creation can be automated and tools that allow for attackers to easily create simple pieces of malware. 

The application that we will be using is called JPS Virus Maker 4.0

This applicaiton is completly open source and takes little effort to find and install. This application allows attacker to plug in the features that they want in the program and create the file.

As you can see, they have a lot of options to choose from. Ranging from crazymouse, which bounces your mouse across the screen uncontrollably, to opening a back door into the system that runs the application.

This is just one setting turned on. I can make this much worse for the user. Let's turn on a few more.

This now makes it look like your computer went dark. This application is hiding the mouse, wallpaper, taskbar, clock, and applications on your desktop. 



The second page of the application starts to get into the more dangerous side of malware creation. This side will allow the attacker to install backdoors into the system. Change the password of the machine. Create logic bombs that will go off at certain times. Inject commands into the command line of the computer. Even become a worm and spread to other machines. Again, this is a free application. 

How about this one...

It doesn't look like it did anything...

But this application actually just opened a backdoor for the attacker to walk right into. This didn't look like it did anything, but this by far was the most dangerous program created in this demo. A backdoor will allow the attacker access to the entire system to do whatever they desire.

This demonstration is just the simple side of malware creation. Malware created by more sophisticated threats can make programs much more dangerous than moving your mouse around your screen. Accidentaly running one of these applications on your computer can give attackers access to anything on your computer. This would also include your camera, allowing attackers to see you and anything in the room. 

The best prevention for this is installing an anti-virus onto your system. Popular ones include Norton360, McAfee, and Bitdefender. However, these applications are not perfect. You must make sure that you too are attempting to avoid these malicious programs while on your device. These can not only come from downloads off of the internet but also from e-mails as well. Do not download files from e-mails unless you are sure that they are safe.

The system used in this demonstration was inside a secure offline enviroment preventing any spread of any malware created.
