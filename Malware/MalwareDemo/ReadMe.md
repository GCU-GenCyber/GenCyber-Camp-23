# Malware Demonstration
### WORK IN PROGRESS


Malware is simpiler to create than you might think. This lesson is a demonstration on how malware creation can be automated and tools that allow for attackers to easily create simple pieces of malware. 

The application that we will be using is called JPS Virus Maker 4.0

This applicaiton is completly open source and takes little effort to find and install. This application allows attacker to plug in the features that they want in the program and create the file.

As you can see, they have a lot of options to choose from. Ranging from crazymouse, which bounces your mouse across the screen uncontrollably, to opening a back door into the system that runs the application.

This is just one setting turned on. I can make this much worse for the user. Let's turn on a few more.

This now makes it look like the screen just went



The second page of the application starts to get into the more dangerous side of malware creation. This side will allow the attacker to install backdoors into the system. Change the password of the machine. Create logic bombs that will go off at certain times. Inject commands into the command line of the computer. Even become a worm and spread to other machines. Again, this is a free application.
