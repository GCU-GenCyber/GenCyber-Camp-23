# Malware Demonstration
### WORK IN PROGRESS


Malware is simpiler to create than you might think. This lesson is a demonstration on how malware creation can be automated and tools that allow for attackers to easily create simple pieces of malware. 

The application that we will be using is called JPS Virus Maker 4.0

This applicaiton is completly open source and takes little effort to find and install. This application allows attacker to plug in the features that they want in the program and create the file.

As you can see, they have a lot of options to choose from. Ranging from crazymouse, which bounces your mouse across the screen uncontrollably, to opening a back door into the system that runs the application.
