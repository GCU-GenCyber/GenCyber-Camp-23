## NIST Cybersecurity Framework 1.1
+ This is a Framework created by the National Institute of Standards and Technology that consists of standards, guidelines and best practices to manage cybersecurity risk. 
+ It is used to improve an organizations cybersecurity standards and manage the risk of cyber threats. 
+ Provides guidelines on security controls and benchmarks for success for organizations from critical infrastructure (power plants, etc) all through to commercial. 
+ Located on an Official Government website.

### NIST Controls 800.53
+ Catalog of Security Controls that protects information systems from a huge range of risks
+ Outlines Security and Privacy controls that are designed to protect the privacy of users 
+ Protects ongoing operations of information systems from threats including:
  + Cybersecurity incidents
  + Privacy breaches
  + Malicious attack
  + Mistakes and human error
+ Helps Federal Agencies meet the requirements of the Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA)
+ Any organization can use them as well

+ Protects the following systems and products
  + Cloud Computing
  + Mobile Systems
  + Healthcare Systems
  + Computing Systems
  + Internet of Things (IoT) Devices
  + System and Networks that control Industry Processes

+ There are 20 "Families" of Controls that relate to specific areas. These are: 
  + Access Control
  + Awareness and Training
  + Audit and Accountability
  + Assessment, Authorization and Monitoring
  + Configuration Management 
  + Contingency Planning
  + Identification and Authentication
  + Incident Response 
  + Maintenance
  + Media Protection
  + Physical and Environmental Protection
  + Planning 
  + Program Management
  + Personnel Security
  + Personally Identifiable Information (PII) Processing and Transparency
  + Risk Assessment
  + System and Services Acquisition
  + System and Communications Protection
  + System and Information Integrity
  + Supply Chain Risk Management

***This information may be dense, but it is EXTREMELY important to know and understand when it comes to working in the field. There is an entire section of jobs dedicated to assuring compliance with these standards and others.***

## National Cyber Security Center Cyber Assessment Framework (NCSC CAF)
+ Framework of 14 principles used to assess the risk of various cyber threats and an organization's defenses against these
  + Focuses On:
    + Data security
    + System security
    + Identity and access control
    + Resiliency
    + Monitoring
    + Response and Recovery Planning
+ Those 14 Principles Include: 
  + A1: Governance
  + A2: Risk Management
  + A3: Asset Management
  + A4: Supply Chain
  + B1: Service Protection Policies and Processes
  + B2: Identity and Access Control
  + B3: Data Security
  + B4: System Security
  + B5: Resilient Networks and Systems
  + B6: Staff Awareness and Training
  + C1: Security Monitoring
  + C2: Proactive Security Event Discovery
  + D1: Response and Recovery Planning
  + D2: Lessons Learned

+ The Cyber Assessment Framework (CAF) provides a systematic and comprehensive approach to assessing the extent of which cyber risks to essential business functions are being managed by an organization. 
+ NCSC developed the CAF as they are a national technical authority for cyber security.
+ They created this with the expectation that it would be used as a tool to support effective cyber regulation.
