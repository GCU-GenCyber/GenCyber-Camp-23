## CIA Triad
***This is one of the most valuable items to someone wanting to learn about Cybersecurity. It is one of the foundations of cyber.***

The CIA Triad is a model that is used to form security systems. It is used to find vulnerabilities and ways to create solutions. When all three standards have been met, the security profile of the organization is stronger and better equipped to handle threat incidents.
There are Three parts to the CIA Triad (Hence the name Triad): 
+ Confidentiality
+ Integrity
+ Availability


### Confidentiality
+ Refers to the protection of data from unauthorized access and misuse
+ This could include employee records, accounting documents, etc. 
+ The goal is to make sure that data is kept private/secret. 
+ Access to information MUST be controlled to prevent the unauthorized access, misuse, or sharing of data
+ Organizations and Companies MUST make sure that people without proper authorization are prevented from accessing assets important to their business
+ However, those who need to have access must have the necessary privileges.
+ This is where ***Availability*** comes in. 
+ Ways to meet Confidentiality include:
  + Classifying and Labeling Restricted Data
  + Enabling Access Control Policies
  + Encrypting Data
  + Using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
  + Employee Awareness and Trainging

### Integrity
+ Involves making sure your data is trustworthy and free from tampering
+ Data is authentic, accurate, and reliable.
+ Information should be kept consistent and correct unless authorized changes have been made.
+ Access Control and Authentication HELP A LOT
+ Ways to Ensure Integrity Include:
  + Hashing
  + Encryption
  + Digital Signatures

### Availability 
+ Refers to the concept of data being available and accessible by the user when AUTHORIZED
+ A system should be available when necessary to prevent damage to reputation of a company or loss of finances
+ Ensuring Confidentiality and Integrity is useless if employees are unable to access the data they need to serve their customers
+ Systems, Networks, and Applications should be up and working when they should and as they should. 
+ It should not take an immense amount of time to access data. 
+ Disasters such as natural or power outages can affect Availability.
+ This is why Disaster Recovery Plans (DRPs) are put into place my most if not all companies. 
+ Ways to Ensure Availability Include:
  + Usage of Redundant Networks, Servers, or Applications
  + Consistently Upgrading or Updating Software
