## Principles of Privileges
Principles of Privileges refer to what level of access employee have. There are various types of principles, but levels of access are always determined by 2 factors:
+ The Individual's Position within a Company/Organization
+ The Sensitivity of the Information Being Stored


### Privileged Identity Management (PIM)
+ This is used to translate a user's roles within an organization into an access role on the system
+ It is a service in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) that enables a person to manage, control, and monitor access to important resources in one's company/organization. 
+ Companies want to lessen the number of people who have access to secure information or resources.  
+ This is because it reduces the chance of: 
  + an authorized user inadvertently impacting a sensitive resource
  + A threat actor getting access. Examples of Threat Actors Include: 
    + Hackers : Typical people trying to hack your infrastructure
    + Hacktivists : Those who promote their cause their cause through hacking
    + Script Kiddies : Can't hack so they grab known scripts; premade attacks
    + Insiders : An employee, someone who has access to the place
    + Competitors : They try to break in and get business info
    + Shadow IT : Any form of IT infrastructure that is being put in an unofficial or potential illegal way. This could be another department within the company installing an access point without permission. 
    + Criminal Syndicates : These are paid people who will Hack, DoS, ransomware, etc. for money. 
    + State Actors : Russians, Chinese, French, state-sponsored long-term threat actors
    + Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) : long-term hacking of something in order to get information over time; could be an organization or person
    + Basically anyone or anything with motive and resources to attack another's IT infrastructure

Privileged Identity Management provides time-based and approval-based role activation to mitigate the risks of excessive, unnecessary, or misused access permissions on resources that a company cares about. Examples of key features of Privileged Identity Management:
+ Provides users temporary permissions to perform privileged tasks and access to Azure AD and Azure resources
+ Assign a role where a user can use the role or have access to materials only within start and end dates
+ Require approval to activate privileged roles
+ Enforce multi-factor authentication to activate any role
+ Get notifications when privileged roles are activated
+ Conduct access reviews to ensure users still need roles
